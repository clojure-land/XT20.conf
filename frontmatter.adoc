= XT20

XT20 is a unique never-to-be-repeated tech conference from JUXT which
will be held on the 10th July 2020.

In the rapid digitization of our world, software developers are
often at the front-line, having a key role to play and working to
contribute to the myriad of initiatives to tackle global problems,
whether they be environmental, health, economic or social.

Today, humanity faces a number of significant and complex
challenges. Sometimes, the scale of the challenge can feel
overwhelming. Of course, this is hardly an atypical situation in the
history of humanity.

During the Victorian period, when we faced a pleathora of challenges,
the inspiring spirit of discovery and invention led to rapid
improvements in human wellbeing.

Necessity is the mother of invention. Add belief, determination and
fortitude, and humans can achieve the impossible.

Come and join us on the 10th of July for a most splendid conference at
Wilton's Music Hall in London.
